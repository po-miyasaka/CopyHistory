# Overview　　
* Accessing copy histories from menubar easily.


# Functions
* Searching with texts
* Filtering histories with star-mark
* Deleting Items

# Setup
This app doesn't depend on any 3rd-party library.
You can build this app with only Xcode.

# Download
You can download this app from [Releases](https://github.com/po-miyasaka/CopyHistory/releases/tag/1.0.1) directly
but I recommend to read and build codes for security.
